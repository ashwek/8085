;2-Digit BCD-to-Binary Conversion

;A BCD number between 0 & 99 is stored in an R/W memory location called
;the Input Buffer (INBUF). Write a program & a conversion subroutine (BCDBIN)
;to convert the BCD number into its equivalent binary number. Store the result
;in a memory location defined as the Output Buffer (OUTBUF)

;INBUF = 2050H
;OUTBUF = 2052H

LXI SP, 4000H   ;StackPointer = 4000H
LXI H, 2050H    ;HL = 2050H (Source address)
LXI D, 2052H    ;DE = 2052H (Destination address)

MOV A, M        ;A = M (Load from source addr)

CALL BCDBIN     ;Call BCDBIN Subrooutine

STAX D          ;Store A at D (Destination address)
